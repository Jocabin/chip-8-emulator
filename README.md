# Chip-8 emulator in Odin

This is my version of the famous [Chip-8 emulator](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8), written in Odin.

## Build the project

Just run the `./build.sh` script, or build/run the project directly with the Odin compiler.

Dont forget to pass as argument the rom file path.
